## Description

The motivation of this project is to create an adaptable space for coding bootcamp students to make notes and a guide to reference in the future.

I built this project to help other students stay organized while learning.

It solves the problem of disorganization and allows the information to be accessed from anywhere instead of having to carry around a notebook.

I learned the basics of some coding languages and how to add and change the project on an elementary level.
